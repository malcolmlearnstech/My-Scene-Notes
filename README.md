# My Scene Notes

</div>

## About

A prototype for a beginner's scenario guide to picking and purchasing fragrance to match an occasion. While only prototyped with fragrances separated by season, the projected goal is to welcome app visitors to a quiz upon entry. The quiz would ask the user questions relating to: season, type of social event(casual, formal, black-tie, etc.), budget range, and time of day, amongst a number of other clarifying questions. These clarifiying questions would ultimately allow My Scene Notes to output a short list of fragrances the user can choose from. List items would include a brief description along with a breakdown of the fragrance notes used to construct the suggested scent.

<strong><em>Stretch Goals</em></strong>: Potential stretch goal would be integration of the Sephora REST API by Api Dojo. This would allow users to immediately place an order for the fragrance of their liking via Sephora Cosmetics and potentially make this order for pick up at the nearest location available.
